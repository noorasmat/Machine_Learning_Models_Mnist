# Machine_Learning_Models_Mnist
SVM, PCA, Artificial Neural Network using Keras API
This repository includes the code in Python, using Jupyter notebook.
Code is about basic Machine learning algorithms i.e. Artificail neural network, SVM, logistic regression and PCA dimentionality reduction technique. 
All the models are tested on Mnist dataset.
