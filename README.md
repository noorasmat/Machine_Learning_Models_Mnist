# Machine_Learning_Models_Mnist
PCA, Artificial Neural Network and Convolutional Neral Network. Keras API from tensorflow has been used. The accuracy, F-measure and classification report using sklearn library has been genrated. The models are applied after PCA dimeion reduction to compare the results. 
This repository includes the code in Python, using Jupyter notebook.
Code is about basic Machine learning algorithms i.e. Artificail neural network, SVM, logistic regression and PCA dimentionality reduction technique. 
All the models are tested on Mnist dataset.
